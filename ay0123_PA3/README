Compile:

run 'make'

Execute:

First start the server on the server machine like below:
./userver 6701
Then start the client on any computer that is connected to the Internet as:
./uclient 6701 input.txt

## the input.txt is my test file. You can put any text file in the same directory to run the program.

Test:
As is required in the assignment spec, any fields of the UDP segment will be
printed to the console. Also a 'client.out' and a 'server.out' file will separately
be generated on client and server sides. It is easy to view the file contents via
the 'cat' command. Please note that the segment payload has a maximum size of 1024
bytes, and the exceeding bytes are truncated if the input file is larger than 1024B.
