# Programming Assignment #2
### Introduction
In this assignment, a web proxy server is implemented. The server can be connected by a single client
 and forward HTTP requests. To speed up, cache mechanism is used as in the specification.
  
  Note that in my implementation the logging file "list.txt" may contain more than 5 recent cached URLs. The logging file contains 
 all the cached URLs from the beginning and updates by adding new lines at the top of the file.

### Compile
```bash
make
```
To clean all the temporary files:
```
make clean
```
### Execute & Test
Server:
```bash
./pyserver <server_port>
```
Client:
```bash
./client <server_port>
url: <url>
```
Here <url> does not start with "http", e.g., [www.baidu.com](www.baidu.com) and [www.cplusplus.com](www.cplusplus.com).
